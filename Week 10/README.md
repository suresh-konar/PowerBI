- Use the Epanechnikov (default) kernel and a high sampling resolution for the violin shape. 
- Show lines in the plot for the first and third quartiles and the median.
- Use a text size of at least 12 points for the x-axis and y-axis labels.
- Format the tooltip so that the measures display as integers (show zero decimal places). 
- Title the chart “2020 Daily Average Temperatures in Denver, Colorado”
